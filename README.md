# Better Motivation Extension

![alt text][comparison]

This extension replaces the boring / useless videos on LinkedIn and replaces them with something better. 

I recently went through the process of hunting for a new job, meaning that I was spending more time on LinkedIn that I would have liked. Scrolling through the posts, I noticed that most of the video content on the site was either clickbait, or just people talking about how great your life will be if you adhere to whatever philosophy they are currently pushing.

Instead of just blocking this content, I decided I could make something better. Something that reminded me to smile and to keep me moving through my search, as unpleasant as it was. I was bored and needed some kind of distraction from the grind of job hunting, so I made this.
